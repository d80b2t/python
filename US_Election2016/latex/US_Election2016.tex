\title{An Analysis in the US 2016 Elections}
%\author{Nicholas P. Ross}
\date{\today}
\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
I'm extremely curious about the statistics involved in the US 2016
Elections.  How was the Presidency {\it exactly} won? What were the
``principle components'' in demography that determined voting
patterns? How did the polls ``get it so wrong''??

As is my style these days, this is something of a living document

\section{Demographics}
demographic (
%%ˌdɛməˈɡrafɪk/
As the adjective, relating to the structure of populations, e.g. ``the demographic trend is towards an older population''. As the noun, a particular sector of a population, e.g., 
``the drink is popular with a young demographic''. 

For our purposes I'd like to concentrate on a few paricular demographics. These are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Age;}
    \item{Gender;}
    \item{Race;}
    \item{Income;}
    \item{Education level;}
\end{itemize}
Now, one ``obvious'' thing here is that these demographics are {\it all correlated with each othe}r to some extent.
