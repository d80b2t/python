Package:
    stat

This is a sub-package of the esutil package. The full reference is esutil.stat

Methods:
    (for full docs, see the individual methods.  E.g. esutil.stat.histogram

    histogram:  
        Calculate the histogram of the input data.  The reverse indices are
        also optionally calculated.  This function behaves similarly to the
        IDL histogram funcion.  Also has the option to use weights, and
        to tabulate a large number of statistics for each bin.
    histogram2d:  
        Histgram two variables.
    wmom:  
        Calculate weighted mean and error for the given input data.
    sigma_clip:  
        Return the sigma-clipped mean and error for the input data.
    interplin:  
        Perform linear interpolation.  This function is less powerful than
        scipy.interpolate.interp1d but behaves like the IDL interpol()
        function, including extrapolation beyond boundaries.
