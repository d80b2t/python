The difference is that the constant G is a Quantity as opposed to the units M_sun, au.
When using constants and Quantities throughout, both ways should work:

import astropy.constants as apc
import astropy.units as apu

print('v={0:}'.format(np.sqrt(apc.G.to('km3/(kg s2)')*apc.M_sun.to('kg')/(1*apu.au).to('km'))))
v=29.788833564362875 km / s

print(?v = {0:.3f}'.format(np.sqrt(apc.G*apc.M_sun/(1*apu.au)).to('km/s')))
v = 29.789 km / s

May not seem too intuitive, and I can?t actually tell you the reasoning why it is behaving
this way, but as the unit is just an attribute of a Quantity, there probably is one?

HTH,
